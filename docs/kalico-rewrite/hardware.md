# Target hardware

- A rigid machine with single spike on each axis resonance graph. 120hz on Y and 180hz on X
- With regular klipper it could achieve motion up to 1000mm/s and 65k acceleration with 65scv before skipping steps.
- Extruder could achieve roughly 50k with acceptable pressure advance before acceleration becomes too high.
- Max flow of about 80mm cubic.
- Host: Pi 5
- MCU1: Octopus Pro with H723, 4 5160 drivers for AB steppers, 1 more 5160 for extruder
- MCU2: Octopus with F4x chip, 2209 for Z
