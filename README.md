Welcome to the Danger Klipper project!

This is a community-maintained fork of the [Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper) firmware.

Our goal is to support features and behavior that could be construed as "risky" if used incorrectly.

If i want my printer to light itself on fire, I should be able to make my printer light itself on fire.
